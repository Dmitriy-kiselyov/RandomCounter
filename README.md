# RandomCounter

Android application that (very solemnly) chooses random number from given range. It was created for physics class because that is how
you get an "A" for physics in my univercity - by random.

First page is a setup page where you choose bounds.

Second page is 2 minute animated philharmonic performance of choosing random number from given bounds, which end up with fireworks!
